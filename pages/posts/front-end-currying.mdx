## Basic definition

Currying is a concept from the computer science world which has become popular in Javascript thanks to the Functional Programming paradigm. It’s the idea of calling a series of functions with a single argument, instead of one function with many arguments:

```js
myFunction(a, b, c, d);
// vs
myFunction(a)(b)(c)(d);
```

This is a pretty heavy-handed simplification and skips over a lot of the true power of currying, but I’m a front-end developer who mostly focuses on the UI. I never made an effort to understand it. It felt very… computer science-y. I didn’t see how I would use it, so I skimmed it and moved on. Then I found myself needing to **conditionally transform some data in a .then() Promise chain**, and suddenly currying was useful and even intuitive.

This article explores one use for currying. There are many more benefits and I leave the rest of the internet’s resources to help you with those. Maybe this can be the start of a beautiful journey into functional programming for you.

We’ll **start with an example that seems a bit silly** (adding two numbers) in order to understand how it works, and then **move on to an example where it feels more natural** (data fetching, Promises, and transforms).

## Currying add()

Normally I would write a function with multiple parameters, and run it by calling it with 2 arguments: 

```js
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
add(1, 2) // returns 3
```

Currying is the idea of taking that series of arguments and separating them into multiple function calls that each take a single parameter:

```js
function add(a) {
    return function(b) {
        return a + b;
    } 
}

const addFirst = add(1) // returns a new function
const sum = addFirst(2) // returns 3
// More succinct:
const sumQuick = add(1)(2) // returns 3
```

1. Runs the function `add` with `1` as an argument
2. `add` returns a function
3. Run this new function with the `2` argument

Thanks to Javascript’s idea of a closure, when we run the first `add(1)` command we create a context where the value of `a` sticks around. When we call the inner function with `b`, it also has access to the `a` value and can use both of them to return a new value.

## Currying in a real use case

That seems a bit obtuse for addition. Where would I actually want or need to use this? Consider Promises:

```js
function async getData() {
    const apiData = await fetch(API_URL);
}
```

The `fetch()` function returns a Promise, and when that Promise is successful I can pass the result to a function of my choice. I use this to transform the API response into something more useful for my application:

```js
function transformData(fetchResponse) {
    return {
        // Here I can modify the data structure given to me by the API
        // In the getData() function below, const result will
        // equal whatever I return here.
    }
}

function async getData() {
    const result = await fetch(API_URL).then(transformData);
}
```

Notice inside the `.then` we don’t run the function with parentheses (`transformData()`), we merely point to it (`transformData`). Javascript will trigger the function to run when it’s ready, and it will run it with the argument returned by the `fetch()` command.

But… what if I need to transform the data in different ways sometimes, depending on when the fetch function is run?

```js
function transformData(fetchResponse) {
    if (meetsSomeCondition) {
        return {
            // one data structure
        }
    }
    return {
        // a different data structure
    }
}
```

Where can we get `meetsSomeCondition` from?

```js
// BROKEN
function async getData(meetsSomeCondition = false) {
    const result = await fetch(API_URL).then(transformData(meetsSomeCondition));
}
```

The above code snippet **will not work.** `.then()` needs a pointer to a function - what we’ve done is run our transformData function which returns an object. 

This is where currying is useful. We’ll make our transformData function return a function, so we can run it once with our condition, and return a shiny new function, ready to be called. Then `.then()` can run it with the fetch result when it needs to:

```js
function transformData(meetsSomeCondition) {
    return function(fetchResponse) {
        if (meetsSomeCondition) {
            return {
                // one data structure
            }
        }
        return {
            // a different data structure
        }
    }
}

function async getData(meetsSomeCondition = false) {
    const result = await fetch(API_URL).then(transformData(meetsSomeCondition));
}
```

## Slimming down with ES6 syntax

The above syntax is kind of a lot. We can make it look cleaner and hopefully easier to skim using ES6 fat arrows. A quick recap of how fat-arrow functions work:

```js
function myFunc(param1, param2) {
    return whatever;
}
// vs (multi-line function)
const myFunc = (param1, param2) => {
    const doStuff = param1 + param2(lol);
    return whatever;
}
// vs (single-expression function that implicitly returns the result)
const myFunc = (param1, param2) => param1 + param2;
```

### Stage 1: Convert to fat arrows

```js
const transformData = (meetsSomeCondition) => {
    return (fetchResponse) => {
        if (meetsSomeCondition) {
            return {
                // one data structure
            }
        }
        return {
            // a different data structure
        }
    }
}
```

### Stage 2: The inner function is a single expression, so we can implicitly return it

```js
const transformData = (meetsSomeCondition) => (fetchResponse) => {
    if (meetsSomeCondition) {
        return {
            // one data structure
        }
    }
    return {
        // a different data structure
    }
}
```

### Stage 3: When fat arrow functions only have one parameter, the parentheses can be skipped

```js
const transformData = meetsSomeCondition => fetchResponse => {
    if (meetsSomeCondition) {
        return {
            // one data structure
        }
    }
    return {
        // a different data structure
    }
}
```

## Summary

We learned how currying works, and saw how to use it when fetching data to transform the result based on an outside condition.

```js
const transformData = meetsSomeCondition => fetchResponse => {
    if (meetsSomeCondition) {
        return {
            // one data structure
        }
    }
    return {
        // a different data structure
    }
}

const getData = async (meetsSomeCondition = false) {
    const result = await fetch(API_URL).then(transformData(meetsSomeCondition));
    return result;
}
```
