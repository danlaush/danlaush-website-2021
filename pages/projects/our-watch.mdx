<Project
  title="Our Watch"
  description="Helped a non-profit on their mission to change the conversation around violence against women with a family of static sites.">
<Container>
<TwoUp title="Project, in brief">

- Domestic violence research group pursuing nationwide behavioural change
- Needed to create "hub" sites about particular topics with shared resources across the family of sites
  - Main Website
  - [Workplace Equality and Respect hub](https://workplace.ourwatch.org.au/)
- __Project deliverables__
  - Nuxt application to static generate each hub site
  - A Single-Page Application "preview" mode for content editors to see the site with data direct from the CMS
  - Modular site design to easily support new web properties
  - WordPress multi-site as a headless CMS, with shared media library and ACF data models

</TwoUp>
<TwoUp title="My role">

- Led development of Nuxt front-end application
- Worked with digital designer who built static templates in HTML/CSS
  - Converted static components to dynamic components in the Vue app
  - Advised on accessibility of digital designs
- Coordinated with developers of CMS+API and DevOps/deployment workflow

</TwoUp>
<TwoUp title="Learnings/notes">

- Working with a digital designer was excellent. I was able to focus on business logic and the designer made sure the web reflected their design vision, without the intermediary flat design file.
- Static sites are faaaaaast
- Static sites from a CMS
- Used a Nuxt plugin written by a colleague
  - Get all routes stored in the CMS with a custom WordPress API endpoint
  - Run this list of routes through nuxt generate
  - Every time an API request is made, create a JSON file of the response
  - When the static site makes an API request, it fetches from the static-deployed JSON file instead of the API
- Static sites add resilience for users because the site can't really go down or get hacked easily.
- However, it's still a new thing for agencies. Much of the build tooling, especially for our multi-site situation, was custom. This could make it more challenging to come back to later on.
