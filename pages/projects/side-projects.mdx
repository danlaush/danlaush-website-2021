In 2017 I started to transition from years of traditional PHP-based templating and client-side jQuery to a more modern JavaScript stack. Along the way I made a few applets to explore ideas and try things out, and towards the end of that process I spoke at a meetup about my learning experience.

- [Audio Update](https://danlaush.github.io/audio-update/dist/) (Vanilla ES6)
  - My own personal Jarvis to wake me up in the morning. Made ES6 Javascript classes with render functions to act as modules in an application. ([GitHub link](https://github.com/danlaush/audio-update))
- [Speed Reader](https://speed-reader-preact.herokuapp.com/) (Preact)
  - Blaze through long articles one word at a time. ([GitHub link](https://github.com/danlaush/speed-reader))
- Video Wall (Vue)
  - Use all of the internet at once. ([GitHub link](https://github.com/danlaush/video-wall))
- [MelbJS Talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wXdb0t2tudLWUzSYxM47qpIZNYWLK0rf3pIm1JQIdhg/edit?usp=sharing)
  - "From HTML-first to HTML-last"

Sometimes my side projects don't make it out of the build stage, but I enjoy spending time brainstorming how an app or interface might work.
