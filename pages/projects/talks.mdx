## Service design on headless Drupal

__Conference: [Drupal South](https://drupalsouth.org/) Nov 18 (Canberra)__

Shared our experience creating a headless content API and two frontend apps.

This was my first Drupal conference, and it was combined with the GovCMS conference (a Drupal distro designed for government). Cool people, interesting stories.

## Put your design system on the wall

__Meetup: [DesignOps](https://designops.lol) Mar 18 (Melbourne)__

Two new apps. One new design system. All in-flight at the same time.

Spoke at a meetup about how printing out our digital design system and sticking it on the wall helped us work together better in a complex environment.

## From HTML-first to HTML-last

__Meetup: [MelbJS](http://melbjs.com/) Sep 17 (Melbourne)__

In 2017 I committed myself to grokking "modern JavaScript" - how do frameworks like React and friends actually work? It was fun to talk about what I'd learned, illustrated with example apps I tried to make along the way. Presentation has notes so it should make sense.
