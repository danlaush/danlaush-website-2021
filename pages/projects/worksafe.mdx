<TwoUp title="Learnings/notes">

- SSR (Server-side rendered) JavaScript 
- CMS-run JS websites are more complex than they seem.
  - Most learning materials focus on working with distinct content types where the frontend defines routes and the IA. It takes some work to let the CMS manage the content tree, metadata, media etc. 
- Pros and Cons: Building a component library for two projects at once in-flight
- I like Vue. Nuxt and Drupal 8 are pretty ok.
- Always wish Drupal had a better content editor interface and workflow
- Not a fan of Drupal's default {JSON:API} spec API
- Storybook was decent to work with. Hard to really tell how useful it is at the beginning - would love to hear from the developers who took over the work.
  - Wished we could have used a more holistic design system documentation tool but couldn't find one that worked well for Vue. Made it work by rendering markdown files in Storybook.
